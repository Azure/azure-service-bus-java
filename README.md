# Microsoft Azure Service Bus Client for Java

**This branch contains code from the legacy Service Bus implementation within the azure-sdk-for-java. The code/library here is in a support only monde, and is primarily here for reference purposes. It will eventually be removed once the new Azure Service Bus Java library (in the other branches of this repository) is generally available and no longer preview. The code was previously located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/0.9).**

Azure Service Bus is an asynchronous messaging cloud platform that enables you to send messages between decoupled systems. Microsoft offers this feature as a service, which means that you do not need to host any of your own hardware in order to use it.

Refer to [azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) to learn more about Service Bus.
