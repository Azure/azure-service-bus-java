#Microsoft Azure Service Bus SDK for Java

This project provides a client library in Java that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Service Bus. For documentation please see the [JavaDocs](http://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-java).

#Getting Started
You will need Java v1.6+. If you would like to develop on the SDK, you will also need maven.

##Via Maven
Maven distributed jars are the recommended way of getting started with the Azure Service Bus Java SDK. You can add the dependency to many of the Java dependency managment tools (Maven, Gradle, Ivy...).

##Via Git
If using package management is not your thing, then you can grab the sdk directly from source using git. To get the source code of the SDK via git just type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java.git
cd ./azure-service-bus-java/
git checkout azure-sdk-for-java-0.9.0
```

## Need some help?
If you encounter any bugs with the SDK please file an issue via [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java/issues) or checkout [StackOverflow for Azure Java SDK](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-java-sdk).
